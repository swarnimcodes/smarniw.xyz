# Me and Emacs

I have been an Emacs user since 4-5 years now. Although admittedly I have also been a 
(Neo)Vim user for a longer duration than I have used Emacs. I still switch back-and-forth
between the two depending on the task at hand and my mood. I have also tried 100s of other
text-editors but none seem to stick with me as these two. I can never get enough of the
extensibility of Emacs and obviously [Magit](https://magit.vc/) holds me hostage, like
every other Emacs user xD. And obviously the efficieny of vim is not unknown.

Each day I used Emacs, I felt like the power to create was at my fingertips but I could
never find something to create that I found worthwhile; something that I myself would use
everyday in my development cycle. I tried learning common lisp and elisp, and the syntax
felt weird because anything I wrote, was a nightmare to read.


# Elisp

Needless to say, I am not a lisp developer by any stretch of the imagination. I use
web & related technologies at work and all those follow procedural or imperative paradigm
and are pretty straightforward to read. And since I was not acclimated to reading lisps,
Elisp felt intimidating and a language for someone more intelligent than me. For instance,
[Protesilaos'](https://protesilaos.com/) work felt like something I could never achieve
even after his brilliant videos that helped me in usage of Emacs. I had given up the idea
of anything relating to writing lisps; but then came along a ray of sunshine in a rainstorm.


# Tsoding writes an Emacs Plugin

Probably doesn't come as a surprise but I absolutely adore 
[Tsoding](https://tsoding.github.io/).
It's astonishing the level of programming he showcases while bringing fun and
rigour to "recreational" programming. He actually might be the reason I am still
programming. All glazing aside, he posted this video:

This video was so fun to watch while he whooshes his magic wand while making elisp look
not just readable, but something fun and something I desired to write programs in.
It was almost enlightening to watch him go through a language that he doesnt program in
and writing code that makes sense to me, sitting probably 1000 miles away.
